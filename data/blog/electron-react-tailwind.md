### Electron.js

The easiest way to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
Electron embeds Chromium and Node.js to enable web developers to create desktop applications.  
Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux, Electron apps run on three platforms across all supported architectures.

### React.js

The library for web and native user interfaces.  
React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.  
Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

### Tailwind.css

Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.  
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like **flex**, **pt-4**, **text-center** and **rotate-90** that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
